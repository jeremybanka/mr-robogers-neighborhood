## Description

Mr. Robogers sure has some weird ideas about how you count numbers!

...He might have gone a little loopy in the head...

If you know what I mean. 😎

Basically he tries to count up to whatever number. If he sees a three in a number he thinks he's supposed to say something friendly. If he sees a two, he makes a boop. If he sees a one, a beep. He only does one of those things and the order of importance is 3, 2, 1.
